Frequently Asked Questions
================================


**What are the advantages of using biocontainers**
  Biocontainers are based on the popular container techonlogy. Due to their ease of deployment and portability, RCAC can deploy a large number of bioinformatic applications on our clusters, and keep adding newer versions. In addition, containerized applications can help improve reproductivity of scientistsâ€™ research. Using biocontainers, you can generate the same results no matter which cluster you are using, and no matter whether you run the program today or 10 years later. 

**Can we use both bioinfo and biocontainers in our job script?**
  No. If you load bioinfo, you will find that you cannot load biocontainers. This is a legacy issue, and all clusters are affected except Bell. So you can use either bioinfo or biocontainers in your job script, just do not use both. 

**How should I load biocontainers after I load bioinfo? The error message shows "biocontainers" is unknown.**
  Run below commands:
   - module purge
   - module load modtree/new
   - module load biocontainers

**I cannot find the path to executables by** ``which`` **?**
  Biocontainers' exectuables are located inside containers instead of the host system of cluster. The commands we provide are actually alias to ``singularity exec /apps/biocontainers/images/image.sif command``. For example, the ``blastp`` command you use is actually ``singularity exec /apps/biocontainers/images/blast.sif blastp``. For applications requiring users to provide exectuable path such as ``RSEM`` and ``MAKER``, please check their specific user guides we provide.
