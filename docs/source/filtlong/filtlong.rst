Filtlong
==============================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~
``Filtlong`` is a tool for filtering long reads by quality. It can take a set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when choosing which reads pass the filter. 

| For more information, please check its website: https://biocontainers.pro/tools/filtlong and its home page on `Github`_.
