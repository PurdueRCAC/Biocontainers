Metaeuk
==============================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~
MetaEuk is a modular toolkit designed for large-scale gene discovery and annotation in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. MetaEuk combines the fast and sensitive homology search capabilities of MMseqs2 with a dynamic programming procedure to recover optimal exons sets. It reduces redundancies in multiple discoveries of the same gene and resolves conflicting gene predictions on the same strand. MetaEuk is GPLv3-licensed open source software that is implemented in C++ and available for Linux and macOS. The software is designed to run efficiently on multiple cores.
