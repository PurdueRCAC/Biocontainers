Hypo
==============================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~
HyPo--a Hybrid Polisher-- utilises short as well as long reads within a single run to polish a long reads assembly of small and large genomes. It exploits unique genomic kmers to selectively polish segments of contigs using partial order alignment of selective read-segments. As demonstrated on human genome assemblies, Hypo generates significantly more accurate polished assembly in about one-third time with about half the memory requirements in comparison to contemporary widely used polishers like Racon.
